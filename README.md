### The Project: 

The goal of the project is to create an automated means of allowing passengers to validate their boarding pass onto their flight without human assistance. The system will be implemented as a self-service kiosk that will use computer vision to extract key information from the boarding pass, digital ID and facial features of eaach passenger. 

The system will be integrated with Microsoft Azure services. These services include Azure Form Recognizer, Azure Face APIs, Azure Custom Vision, Azure Video Indexer and Azure Blob Storage. The system will use a Python runtime to carry out the process. 

### Installations: 
The following packages will be required for the project: 
1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib
3. Pillow
4. Dotenv
5. Azure core
6. Video Indexer
7. Azure AI Formrecognizer
8. Azure Cognitive Services Vision Computervision
